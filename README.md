# Robinhood Panic Seller

This script looks through your messages every second to see if your mother or a target sender has sent you a text message. If so, it parses the message and looks to see if Gamestop or AMC are mentioned. If so, this script will log into your Robinhood account and sell everything. Stocks, options, and crypto.
